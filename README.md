### From VS Code Marketplace (For Mortals)

2. Go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X` - or just click the squares icon if you're feeling fancy)

4. Click Install (the big button that says "Install" - we believe in you!)
5. Select the theme from `File > Preferences > Color Theme` and prepare for enlightenment

### From Command Line (For Terminal Wizards)
```bash
code --install-extension jeremy-gower.purply-theme
# ^ This line literally makes you 15% cooler
```

### The Ancient Ritual Method
1. Draw a perfect purple circle in the dirt
2. Place your laptop in the center
3. Chant "npm install" three times while spinning counterclockwise
4. ...actually, just use one of the methods above

Perfect for:
- Vampire developers who fear the sun

Ideal for:
- Morning people (we don't understand you, but we respect your choices)
- Offices with fluorescent lighting that could blind a bat
- Developers who shower before noon
- Anyone brave enough to code with the lights on

**Side Effects**: May cause coworkers to wonder if you've been replaced by a pod person

## 🔧 Customization (For Perfectionists and Control Freaks)

Think you can make perfection even more perfect? Bold of you! But we'll humor you:

```json
{
  "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
    "[Purply (Dark)]": {
      // Your "improvements" here
      "editor.background": "#1a1423",
      // Pro tip: Don't mess with perfection
    },
    "[Purply (Light)]": {
      // Your custom colors here
      "editor.background": "#fdfcff",
      // But if you must, at least keep it purple-ish
    }
  }
}
```

**Disclaimer**: We are not responsible for themes that become less purple due to user modifications. Purple purity is sacred.
