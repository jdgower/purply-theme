5. Select the theme from `File > Preferences > Color Theme` and prepare for enlightenment

### From Command Line (For Terminal Wizards)

```bash

# ^ This line literally makes you 15% cooler
```

### The Ancient Ritual Method

1. Draw a perfect purple circle in the dirt
2. Place your laptop in the center
3. Chant "npm install" three times while spinning counterclockwise
4. ...actually, just use one of the methods above

## üîß Customization (For Perfectionists and Control Freaks)

Think you can make perfection even more perfect? Bold of you! But we'll humor you:

```json
{
  "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
    "[Purply (Dark)]": {
      // Your "improvements" here
      "editor.background": "#1a1423"
      // Pro tip: Don't mess with perfection
    },
    "[Purply (Light)]": {
      // Your custom colors here
      "editor.background": "#fdfcff"
      // But if you must, at least keep it purple-ish
    }
  }
}
```

**Disclaimer**: We are not responsible for themes that become less purple due to user modifications. Purple purity is sacred.
