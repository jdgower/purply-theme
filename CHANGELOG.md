### üéâ MAJOR RELEASE - The Purple Awakening

Ladies, gentlemen, and non-binary coding wizards, behold! We've taken the old Purply Theme out back, given it a complete makeover, and taught it how to be fabulous. This is basically the theme equivalent of a glow-up montage in a 90s movie.

### ‚ú® Added (The Purple Treasures)

## ü§ù Contributing (Join the Purple Cult)

Ready to join our purple revolution? Here's how to contribute without messing everything up:

1. Fork the repository (like taking a purple cutting from our garden)
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/EvenMorePurple`)
3. Make your changes (but remember: when in doubt, add more purple)
4. Write meaningful commit messages (not "fixed stuff" - we see you)
5. Test your changes (purple must remain purple)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/EvenMorePurple`)
7. Open a Pull Request with a description that doesn't make us cry

**Contribution Guidelines:**
- All changes must increase the overall purple quotient
- No Comic Sans in code comments
- If you break the purple, you buy the next round of coffee

## üìÑ License (The Legal Purple Print)

This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for the boring legal stuff.

**Translation:** Do whatever you want, just don't blame us if you become obsessed with purple.

**Made with üíú, questionable life choices, and an unhealthy obsession with the color purple by the Purply Theme team**

*P.S. - If you're reading this far down in a changelog, you might be as obsessed with details as we are with purple. We respect that.*
