## [2.0.1] - 2025-08-09

### üçä‚û°Ô∏èüíú THE GREAT ORANGE PURGE - "Operation Purple"

Breaking news from the Department of Color Correctness: We have successfully eliminated the Orange Menace from our beautiful purple kingdom! This emergency hotfix was deployed after numerous reports of "aggressive orange" causing visual distress in sidebars worldwide.

#### üö® Critical Bug Fixes (The Orange Intervention)

- **ELIMINATED** the orange folder menace from file explorer sidebars (orange is so 2023, purple is eternal)
- **NEUTRALIZED** bright orange git decorations that were trying to steal purple's spotlight
- **REPLACED** orange with sophisticated gray tones because sometimes you need backup dancers for the purple star
- **UPGRADED** modified file colors from "LOOK AT ME I'M ORANGE" to "I'm subtly gray and purple-adjacent"
- **BANISHED** orange find highlights in favor of proper purple supremacy
- **CONVERTED** warning colors from orange chaos to civilized amber (orange's more sophisticated cousin)

#### üé® Color Psychology Improvements

- Sidebar text now speaks in soothing gray whispers instead of orange screams
- File tree colors now practice proper purple etiquette
- Git decorations have been enrolled in Purple Sensitivity Training
- All colors now bow appropriately to their purple overlords

#### ü¶Ñ User Testimonials

- _"Finally, I can look at my sidebar without my retinas filing a complaint!"_ - Anonymous Developer
- _"My cat stopped hiding when I opened VS Code. Thanks, Purply Team!"_ - Cat Owner #47
- _"I make up testimonials because I'm the only one using this."_ - Purply Creator

### üíú What We Learned

Orange may be the new black, but purple is the eternal monarch of the color spectrum. We apologize for any temporary orange-induced trauma and have implemented strict No-Orange policies going forward.
